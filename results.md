Extract information of from the tables. Return the answer in table form. Only return the desired answer.

The image you've provided appears to be a scanned document with several tables. The tables are related to plate counts, mean values, and slope measurements for a specific product or process. However, due to the quality of the image and the handwritten notes, it's challenging to extract the exact information from the tables. If you can provide a clearer image or type out the data from the tables, I would be happy to help you with the information extraction.
